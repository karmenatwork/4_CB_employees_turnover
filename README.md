# Employee Turnover Analytics

Project Statement:

Portobello Tech is an app innovator that has devised an intelligent way of predicting employee turnover within the company. It periodically evaluates employees' work details, including the number of projects they worked on, average monthly working hours, time spent in the company, promotions in the last 5 years, and salary level.

Data from prior evaluations show the employeesâ€™ satisfaction at the workplace. The data could be used to identify patterns in work style and their interest in continuing to work in the company. 

The HR Department owns the data and uses it to predict employee turnover. Employee turnover refers to the total number of workers who leave a company over a certain time period.

As the ML Developer assigned to the HR Department, you have been asked to create ML Programs to:
1. Perform data quality checks by checking for missing values if any.
2. Understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover by EDA.
3. Perform clustering of Employees who left based on their satisfaction and evaluation.
4. Handle the left Class Imbalance using the SMOTE technique.
5. Perform k-fold cross-validation model training and evaluate performance. 
6. Identify the best model and justify the evaluation metrics used. 
7. Suggest various retention strategies for targeted employees.


| Column Name          | Description        |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| satisfaction_level   | satisfaction level at the job of an employee |
| last_evaluation      | Rating between 0 to 1, received by an employee at his last evaluation |
| number_project       | Number of projects an employee is involved in |
| average_montly_hours | Average number of hours in a month spent by an employee at the office
| time_spend_company   | Number of years spent in the company
| Work_accident        | 0 - no accident during employee stay, 1 - accident during employee stay
| left                 | 0 indicates employee stays in the company, 1 indicates employee left the company
| promotion_last_5years| Number of promotions in his stay
| Department           | Department which an employee belongs to
| salary               | Salary in USD

Perform the following steps:

1. Perform data quality checks by checking for missing values, if any
2. Understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover by EDA

    2.1 Draw a heatmap of the Correlation Matrix between all numerical features/columns in the data

    2.2 Draw the distribution plot of:
    - Employee Satisfaction (use column satisfaction_level)
    - Employee Evaluation (use column last_evaluation)
    - Employee Average Monthly Hours (use column average_montly_hours)
    
    2.3 Draw the bar plot of the Employee Project Count of both employees who left and stayed in the organization (use column number_project and hue column left), and give your inferences from the plot

3. Perform clustering of employees who left based on their satisfaction and evaluation
    3.1 Choose columns satisfaction_level, last_evaluation and left
    3.2 Do K-Means clustering of employees who left the company into 3 clusters?
    3.3 Based on the satisfaction and evaluation factors, give your thoughts on the employee clusters
